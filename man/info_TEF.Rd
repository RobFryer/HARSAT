\title{TEFs for selected groups of compounds}
\format{
A list of named vectors:
\itemize{
\item \code{DFP_2005} gives the 2005 World Health Organisation TEFs for dioxins,
furans and dioxin-like (planar) polychlorinated biphenyls
(\href{https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfl055}{Van den Berg et al. 2006})
\item \code{DFP_2022} gives the 2022 World Health Organisation TEFs for dioxins,
furans and dioxin-like (planar) polychlorinated biphenyls
(\href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yrtph.2023.105525}{DeVito et al. 2024})
\item \code{DFP_HOLAS3} is a superseded version of \code{DFP_2005} that was used in the
HELCOM HOLAS3 assessment. It excludes CB114, CB123 and CB189 and uses code
CDFO instead of OCDF. It is included for reproducibility, but might be
removed in the future.
\item \code{DFP_CEMP} is a superseded version of \code{DFP_2005} that was used in the
OSPAR CEMP assessments up to and including 2024. It excludes CB114, CB123 and
CB189, uses code CDFO instead of OCDF, and has a TEF for CDFO of 0.00003
rather than 0.0003. It is included for reproducibility, but might be removed
in the future.
