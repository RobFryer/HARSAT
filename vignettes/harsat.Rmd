## Installing harsat from GitHub

To install the latest development version, use the `remotes` package:

```
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("osparcomm/harsat", auth_token = 'XXXX') 
```

> Note: during development the repository is marked as private on GitHub, so you
> will need a Personal Access Token (or PAT) to access it. Follow
> [these instructions to create a Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token).
> It'll be a short string, probably beginning with `ghp_`. Put the whole
> string into the `auth_token` parameter, and that should install the 
> `harsat` package directly.
