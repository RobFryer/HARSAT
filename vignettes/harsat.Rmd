For now, we will assume that you are familiar with running basic R scripts
and so on. We will focus on what the structure of a typical what the code 
looks like in a typical analysis.

## Installing `harsat` from a bundled package

If you have a downloaded copy of the bundled package, whch will be a file
named something like `harsat_0.1.2.tar.gz` or `harsat_0.1.2.tar`, you 
can install that directly, and R will still take care of making sure 
you have all the right dependencies.

### In RStudio

From the `Packages` tab, choose `Install`, make sure you have selected
to install from a Package Archive File, then press the `Browse...` button
and locate your bundled package file. Then finally press the `Install` 
button.

### From the R command line

Use a command:

```r
install.packages(remotes) -- if needed
library(remotes)
remotes::install_local("~/Downloads/harsat_0.1.2.tar")
```

Use the right file for the downloaded package file, press enter, and
away you go.

## Installing `harsat` directly from GitHub

To install the latest version, use the `remotes` package:

```r
# install.packages(remotes) -- if needed
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("osparcomm/harsat@main") 
```

The development version is similar:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("osparcomm/HARSAT@develop")
```

> Note: many of the functions currently have a `cstm` prefix. When the
> code was originally developed, we thought of it as "contaminant time series modelling", 
> which is why you get all these `cstm` prefixes. These will be removed in the 
> near future.

## Loading the code

Now, within R, you can load the library in the usual way


```r
library(harsat)
```

## Accessing files

How you organize your files is up to you. 
We set up our main directory to find
the data files. If you use your own data files, you will need to point to
a directory containing a copy. We usually do this by putting our data files
in a directory `data`, and information files in a directory `information`,
but you can use any directory for these.

```r
working.directory <- 'C:/Users/robfr/Documents/HARSAT/HARSAT'
```

## Reading in the data

The first step is to read in the data that we've got, using `read_data()`.
We will go through some of these arguments.


```r
water_data <- read_data(
  compartment = "water",
  purpose = "OSPAR",
  contaminants = "water.txt",
  stations = "stations.txt",
  data_dir = file.path(working.directory, "data", "example_OSPAR"),
  info_dir = file.path(working.directory, "information", "OSPAR_2022"),
  extraction = "2023/08/23"
)

#> Found in path species.csv C:\Users\robfr\Documents\HARSAT\HARSAT\information\OSPAR_2022\species.csv

#> Reading station dictionary from:

```

The main arguments here are as follows:

* `compartment` is an argument which specifies whether we're dealing with a 
  biota assessment, a sediment assessment, or a water assessment.
* `purpose` means we can mirror an `OSPAR` style assessment, a `HELCOM` style assessment, 
  an `AMAP`-style assessment, or `other` which means you can basically tailor it yourself 
  and the idea is that the code will be sufficiently flexible that you can do a lot of 
  tailoring to suit your own needs.
* `contaminants` is a data file which has all the chemical measurements in it.
* `stations` is the station file which is directly related to the station dictionary 
  that we get out at from ICES.
* `info_dir` is your directory for reference tables -- we will come back to that.

This reads in the three data sets, but does no more than that at this stage.

Once you get to this point, you can look at the data if you want to, or 
do anything else that you need with the data before proceeding. 
Essentially the files that come in at this point are unchanged from the files that we are reading them in from.
This is basically just reading in the data and setting things up.

At this point we might want to do a whole lot of *ad hoc* corrections to these data,
as is done with the OSPAR estimates. 

## Tidying the data

The next step is to clean the data to prepare for analysis, using `tidy_data()`. This step tidies up the 
data structures that we've got there. It does filtering so that we get data in the
 form that we want for say, an OSPAR assessment or a HELCOM assessment.
It also streamlines some of the data files.

This may generate warnings. For example, when we're cleaning the station dictionary, 
we've may find some issues with duplicate stations. Similarly, when it comes to cleaning the contaminant and biological effects data, 
we've may find some data from stations which are unrecognized by the station dictionary. Sometimes that's fine and sometimes that's not.
Warnings are supported by output files which allow you to come in and have a look and 
see which values are affected, so you can go and check them out in more detail.


```r
water_data <- tidy_data(water_data)
#> 
#> Oddities will be written to 'oddities/water' with previous oddities backed up to
#>  'oddities/water_backup'
#> 
#> Dropping 411 records from data flagged for deletion. Possible reasons are:
#>  - vflag = suspect
#>  - upper depth >5.5m
#>  - filtration missing
#>  - matrix = 'SPM'
#> 
#> Dropping 94 records from data that have no valid station code
#> 
#> Dropping 13633 stations that are not associated with any data
#> 
#> Cleaning station dictionary
#> 
#> Cleaning contaminant and biological effects data
```

To this point, we've still not done anything with the datasets.

## Create a time series

Now we can group the data into time series, using `create_timeseries()`. This means identifying which data points 
belong to the same time series, and then set it up as a structure which then allows us 
to do the assessments.

There are various different ways in which we can specify which determinants we actually 
want to assess. In this case, the `determinands` parameter specifies CHR, BBKF, PFOS, CB138, HCEPX, and HCH. 
There are various other arguments which allow you to control 
just how the data are manipulated.


```r
water_timeseries <- create_timeseries(
  water_data,
  determinands.control = list(
    CHR = list(det = "CHRTR", action = "replace"),
    BBKF = list(det = c("BBF", "BKF", "BBJF", "BBJKF"), action = "bespoke"),
    PFOS = list(det = c("N-PFOS", "BR-PFOS"), action = "sum"),
    CB138 = list(det = c("CB138+163"), action = "replace"),
    HCEPX = list(det = c("HCEPC", "HCEPT"), action = "sum"), 
    HCH = list(det = c("HCHA", "HCHB", "HCHG"), action = "sum")
  )
)
#> 
#> Oddities will be written to 'oddities/water' with previous oddities backed up to
#>  'oddities/water_backup'
#> 
#> Cleaning data
#>    Dropping stations with no data between 2017 and 2022
#>    Unexpected or missing values for 'basis': see basis_queries.csv
#>    Replicate measurements, only first retained: see replicate_measurements.csv
#>    Non-positive detection limits: see non_positive_det_limits.csv
#>    Limit of quantification less than limit of detection: see limits_inconsistent.csv
#>    Censoring codes D and Q inconsistent with respective limits: see censoring_codes_inconsistent.csv
#>    Detection limit higher than data: see detection_limit_high.csv
#>    Implausible uncertainties reported with data: see implausible_uncertainties_reported.csv
#>    Data submitted as CHRTR relabelled as CHR 
#>    Data submitted as BBF, BKF summed to give BBKF
#>      1 of 71 samples lost due to incomplete submissions
#>    Data submitted as BBJF, BKF summed to give BBJKF
#>      99 of 99 samples lost due to incomplete submissions
#>    Data submitted as HCEPC, HCEPT summed to give HCEPX
#>    Data submitted as HCHA, HCHB, HCHG summed to give HCH

#> 
#> Creating time series data
#>    Converting data to appropriate basis for statistical analysis
#>    Dropping groups of compounds / stations with no data between 2017 and 2022
```

## Assessment

The next the next stage is to do the assessment, using `run_assessment()`.

We've created a time series object, and pass that into this call.
We have to say which thresholds we're going to use when we do the assessment and there are other options which we can put in here.
But this will just run.
You can see that it tells you which time series we're actually assessing as it progresses.
This gives you an idea of how how many cups of tea you can drink before it's all finished.


```r
water_assessment <- run_assessment(
  water_timeseries, 
  AC = "EQS", 
  parallel = TRUE
)
#> Setting up clusters: be patient, it can take a while!
```

There are various little warnings: these ones are nothing to worry about.

We can then check that everything is converged, using `check_assessment()`.


```r
check_assessment(water_assessment)
#> All assessment models have converged
```

## Reporting

We can then get a summary table of our results. We want a directory where
we can put it. And `harsat` won't create a directory if there's nothing
there, so let's make a new directory, `./output/tutorial`, and put the full
path into `summary.dir`, so we can tell `harsat` where to write to.


```r
summary.dir <- file.path(working.directory, "output", "tutorial")

if (!dir.exists(summary.dir)) {
  dir.create(summary.dir, recursive = TRUE)
}
```

And then we can generate the summary proper, using `write_summary_table()`.
The summary file which will be very familiar to those who have been involved in the OSPAR and the HELCOM
assessments. The summary files have information about each time series, 
what the time series represents (which is the first set of columns), followed
by statistical results, such as p values, and summary values such as the number of years in the data set,
when it starts and finishes. And towards the end, we've got comparisons against various different threshold values.


```r
write_summary_table(
  water_assessment,
  determinandGroups = list(
    levels = c(
      "Metals", "Organotins", "PAH_parent",  "Organofluorines", 
      "Chlorobiphenyls", "Organochlorines", "Pesticides"
    ),  
    labels = c(
      "Metals", "Organotins", "PAH parent compounds", "Organofluorines", 
      "Polychlorinated biphenyls", "Organochlorines (other)", "Pesticides"
    )
  ),
  classColour = list(
    below = c("EQS" = "green"), 
    above = c("EQS" = "red"), 
    none = "black"
  ),
  collapse_AC = list(EAC = "EQS"),
  output_dir = summary.dir
)
#> Error in write_summary_table(water_assessment, determinandGroups = list(levels = c("Metals", : unused argument (classColour = list(below = c(EQS = "green"), above = c(EQS = "red"), none = "black"))
```
